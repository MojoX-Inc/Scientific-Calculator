# Scientific Calculator

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** based advanced scientific calculator built with Python. This calculator supports a wide range of mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to advanced scientific computations like derivatives, integrals, matrix operations, and more. The calculator is designed for engineers, scientists, and students who need a powerful and reliable tool for their computations.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Advanced Operations**:
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`.
  - Logarithmic functions: `log`, `ln`.
  - Square root, power, and reciprocal operations.
- **Scientific Computations**:
  - Derivatives and integrals (symbolic and numeric).
  - Equation solving.
  - Matrix operations (addition, multiplication).
  - Complex number operations.
- **Graphing**:
  - Plot mathematical functions in the range of your choice.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Simple, clean, and intuitive GUI using Tkinter.
  - History section to keep track of previous calculations.
